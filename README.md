# Course Scheduler

Clemson University Annual Hackathon (29-30th January 2022) project:

The web app lets users (students) enter their desired classes for the upcoming semester and generates a chart of multiple schedule options to navigate and grade distributions pie charts of those classes. There is a feature to add and view the reviews of the classes and instructors.
